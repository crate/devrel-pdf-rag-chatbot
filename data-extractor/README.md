## First Steps

First, you'll need to get a local copy of the code, set up a CrateDB database and get an OpenAI API key.  Follow the instructions in the [main README](../README.md), returning here when you're ready.

## Preparing a Virtual Environment

You should create and activate a Python Virtual Environment to install this project's dependencies into.  To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
cd data-extractor
python -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```
Now install the dependencies that this project requires:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## TODO

```bash
python extract.py
```
